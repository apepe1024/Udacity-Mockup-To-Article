Udacity Mockup To Article project.

Reflections:

* What new skills have you learned?

    Well for one I learned that there are more than just basic HTML tags, but I feel as though I would use most of these in CSS rather than hard coded into the HTML itself. I'm not entirely sure which is best practice.

* What has been easy?

    What I already knew.

* What has been difficult?

    Formatting individual lines in HTML. I feel like there's a better way to do it.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

    Yeah.
